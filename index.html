            Logo Idea: <img src="images/Logo.gif" alt="" style = "width : 100px;">
            <h1> Who will be the audience of your website? </h1>
            <p>Our audience will be mostly focused on ladies or mothers who are always having to think for their breakfast,dinner, and suooer for their family. With the easy recipes, it will help the women, also men, to give ideas for their food.</p>
            <h1>What will be the specific purpose of your website?</h1>
            <p>Our specific purpose of this website is to ease the difficulites to make different recipes for themselves or for their family, and also to satisfy people's expectation during parties</p>
            <h1>Who is the client?</h1>
            <p>Our client is the cook of the house or any resturant chefs</p>
            <h1>What are the success criteria?   How will you know when your goals have been met?  When will you celebrate (and dance around)?</h1>
            <p>If our website is successful, clients that visted our website will be able to cook a delicious meal by following our instruction</p>
            <h1>Identify the major priorities for your website. What is most important to give to your audience first?</h1>
            <p>The major priorities for this website is to not to give the image of hard recipes that can not be made by people who do not have any experience, but an image where everyone could make easily without diffculites</p>
            <h1>Name three or four stages / parts of your website development plan</h1>
            <p>Firstly we would like to create homepage for recipes that are popular. One the subpages there will be Asian, Western, Thai, and Dessert  as our subpage. These would lead to different type and abundant amount of recipes to choose from. There would also be a subpage where guests could make an account so they can add their favourite recipes. Lastly, there will be a page for basic material, and it would an online type of page, so people could buy materials they lack of with a reasonable price</p>
